                <h1> The Passage of Time </h1>
                <h2> Week 1 </h2>
                <p> I spent my first week familiarizing myself with the problem space I would be working in. My mentor, Jessica, gave me a list of papers to read to learn more about the field of visualization and the specific problem of visualizing uncertainty. My favorite paper was "Displayed Uncertainty Improves Driving Experience and Behavior: The Case of Range Anxiety in an Electric Car" by Jung et al. It describes the effects of displaying a gradient on the range meter instead of an exact value for remaining number of miles. The paper illustrated for me the importance of showing users uncertainty, so that the trust a user places in a device’s prediction isn’t misused. Uncertainty is a part of the future, and predictions attempt to create a clearer picture of the future. Thus, not showing the uncertainty in a prediction is a fundamental flaw of the many systems that simply show a point prediction.</p>
                
                <p class = "bottom">Apart from reading papers, I also worked on setting up my dev environment, and started looking at how we can collect historical data using the OneBusAway API in order to create a model that predicts a probability distribution for the arrival of buses in Seattle.</p>
                <h2> Week 2 </h2>
                <p>This week I worked on setting up a script to get the historical data, and collected information along with my team on when buses actually arrive at bus stops to check how reality compares to the data we get form the OneBusAway API.</p>
                
                <p>My team and I also established the schedule for the rest of the summer. Our goal is to run a survey to get information on how OneBusAway is used. We will meet for a few design brainstorming sessions. We will then shortlist our designs based on our survey results, and test our designs in the lab. We will then further refine our designs and test them on Mechanical Turk. Based on these results, I will code up the designs in Android. This alternative version of OneBusAway will then be further tested, refined, and deployed in September.</p>
                
                <p>I spent the rest of the week setting up the database to store the historical data, and thinking about the probabilistic model that we need to develop for the bus arrival data. I also started testing my Android development knowledge, which has been dormant for the last year, so that when it is time to code up the designs, I can do so efficiently.</p>
                
                <p class = "bottom">I continued reading relevant papers, and jotting down design ideas for our design meeting next week.</p>
                <h2> Week 3 </h2>
                <p> This was an exciting week. I spent the first half of the week working on the final designs for the probabilistic model and the database. On Wednesday the team met up for our first design brainstorming session. I then spent Thursday analyzing our designs and categorizing them according to information representation systems and features. We identified areas where we need to work on further designs. I will now be working on the second round of design drafts based on our discussion.</p>
                
                <p class = "bottom">Apart from designing databases, algorithms, and visualizations, I also worked on creating a survey for OneBusAway users to help us identify user goals so that we are designing with our users’ interests in mind.</p>
