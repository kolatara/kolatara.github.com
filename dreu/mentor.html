                <p> Here is an excerpt from Dr. Hullman's website on her work:</p>
                
                <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the iSchool at University of Washington and an adjunct Assistant Professor at UW CSE, where I research and teach Information Visualization and HCI. I am a member of the Interactive Data Lab and the DataLab. Formerly I was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley Computer Science, working with Maneesh Agrawala and supported by Tableau Software. My Ph.D. and MSI are from the University of Michigan School of Information, where I worked with Eytan Adar.</p>
                <p>My research focuses on helping people understand data through information visualization and data tools. As used online by the media, scientists, and casual data analysts, information visualizations provide context and support deeper analytical insights related to data and text. Professional designers construct useful visual aids for understanding data by carefully considering design trade-offs, yet their processes do not scale. For visualizations and other data summaries to be helpful calls for insight into how people reason with data, and tools that enable data understanding at scale, which is the goal of my work.</p>
