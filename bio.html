<h1> A Brief Biography</h1>

<p>Tara Kola was born and raised in Saratoga, CA till the age of 13, when she moved to Bangalore, India. Here name means "star" in Sanskrit, but her parents may not have realized that her namesakes include the Star Goddess who was the adulterous lover of the Moon God, Chandra; the Tantric Goddess Tara who represents a star's self-combusting, unquenchable thirst for life; the Buddhist deity of hard work, compassion, and much else; and the name of the plantation in "Gone with the Wind". Adultery and plantations apart, her name reflects her love for the study of various cultures, religions, and linguistic traditions. Tara Kola - to be distinguished from all the Goddesses she is not - is a student at Tufts University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Chinese. With a variety of intellectual interests, she chose her major in Computer Science to learn the tools that would help her better analyze information and solve problems in all the disparate fields she hopes to learn more about in the future. In this vein, she is currently working with the Village 0 Project, which uses data analysis to understand the seasonality of cholera epidemics in Bangladesh. She is also currently in the EPIIC program at Tufts, in which she has embarked on a year-long journey to understand Global Health and Security. Through this program, she hopes to research the evergrowing field of health informatics. Her future goals include writing a book about how different cultures create different frameworks for structuring life, becoming fluent in Chinese, building great products that stretch the application of computational tools, living in Istanbul, perfecting the art of Chai-making, and working on education reform.</p>

<p>Outside of the classroom, she enjoys consuming Boston's wonderful eatables (Baraca in Central Square, Le's in Harvard Square, and Ball Square Cafe being highly recommended). She loves used bookstore and libraries, yoga, and long runs. She is also a dancer, having studied Bharatnatyam since the age of 5 from the Dhananjayans, and the Shridhars of Bangalore. It should also be noted that she frequents the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and like the Goddesses she represents, has embraced the deep spirituality of "Live Free or Die".</p>
